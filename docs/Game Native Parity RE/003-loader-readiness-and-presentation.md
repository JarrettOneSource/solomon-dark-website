# Loader readiness and presentation

Native owner and renderer:

- startup construction: `0x005BAB60`;
- `MyLoader` renderer: `0x005BCA40`;
- embedded `Bundle_Loader`: `MyLoader + 0x78`;
- completed-work global: `DAT_0081F6A8`;
- total-work global: `DAT_0081F6AC`;
- forced-complete byte: `DAT_0081F6B0`.

The native loader is a real readiness gate, not a timed splash. Every render
computes `progress = completed / total`, clamps it to `1`, and calls the
loader's vtable slot `+0x18` only when progress is at least `1` (or the
forced-complete byte is set). The menu cannot render before that completion
dispatch.

The renderer also corrects an older static-art conclusion. It calls four
sprite draw helpers on fields inside the `MyLoader` object:

- `this + 0xB0` (`Bundle_Loader` record 0);
- `this + 0x174` (record 1);
- `this + 0x238` (record 2);
- `this + 0x2FC` (record 3).

Because these are embedded-owner-relative accesses rather than references
through published singleton `DAT_008199BC`, a singleton-only consumer search
incorrectly classified all Loader records as dormant. A clean mod-free 60 fps
desktop capture at
`C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\solomon-clean-startup-0811.mkv`
confirms that records 0..3 render the Raptisoft mark, URL, bar chrome, and red
fill. Only record 4 remains unobserved in this renderer.

The exact logical composition recovered from `0x005BCA40` and the Loader
bundle metadata is:

- a `480 x 320` virtual canvas, centered with
  `((surfaceWidth - 480) / 2, (surfaceHeight - 320) / 2)`;
- clear color `(0, 0, 0.33, 1)`;
- record 2 at top-left `(41, 13)`, logical size `388 x 227`;
- record 3 at top-left `(119, 251)`, logical size `244 x 18`;
- record 1, logical size `54 x 230`, centered at `(240, 290)` and rotated
  `90 degrees`, producing the horizontal bar frame;
- record 0, logical size `18 x 192`, centered at `(240, 291)` and rotated
  `90 degrees`, producing the red gradient fill.

Progress is not primitive colored geometry. `FUN_00420ec0` installs a clip
rectangle `(0, 0, 144 + progress * 192, 320)`; the renderer then draws the
entire rotated record 0 and clears the clip with `FUN_00420e40`. Since the
rotated fill spans logical `x=144..336`, the visible fill width is exactly
`progress * 192`. This ownership distinction matters: the web loader must crop
the native gradient rather than approximate it with a CSS color ramp.

In that run the native bar advanced in discrete work-completion steps and the
loader disappeared immediately after readiness; the title screen followed
under its ordinary fade. The web implementation consequence is:

1. preload and decode the resident `/game` asset manifest;
2. drive progress from completed asset tasks, not elapsed time;
3. keep the main menu unmounted until all required tasks succeed;
4. render the extracted Loader sprite records and clip the native fill sprite;
5. transition only when progress is complete.

Confidence: high from the full renderer instruction stream, draw-helper
decompilation, bundle metadata, and clean stock startup capture.

The 2026-08-13 unified-renderer cutover now presents this exact `480 x 320`
composition through `renderer/loader-renderer.ts`: the blue clear, records 2
and 3, both rotated bar records, and the progress-width mask are one WebGL
scene. `Game.tsx` still owns readiness and does not mount the title until the
resident asset promise succeeds. The loader therefore remains a real work
gate; only its browser painter changed. `NativeLoader.tsx` retains the live
semantic percentage as a DOM status surface and paints no artwork.
