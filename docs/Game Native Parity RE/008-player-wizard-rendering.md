# Player wizard rendering

## Runtime object validation

- Preferred gameplay-global address `0x0081C264`; runtime address in this run
  `0x010CC264`.
- Runtime gameplay pointer observed: `0x02E87AD8`.
- Player field is at gameplay object `+0x1358`; runtime actor pointer observed:
  `0x16260410`.
- Selector bytes at actor `+0x23c..+0x240` were
  `00 00 00 00 01` in the hub.
- Those bytes belong to the generic source-wizard descriptor path. They do not
  select the equipped local player's robe-frame index.

## Native painter split

Relevant functions:

- Wizard body renderer: `0x00621780`.
- Wizard attachment compositor: `0x0061AF10`.
- Staff attachment renderer: `0x00578D20`.

A clean one-shot debugger trace on the stock local player additionally resolved
the active attachment renderer at `0x00538B80`. Its return chain includes the
animation/body driver `0x0054BA80`. This path exposes the equipped-item decision
more clearly than the generic `0x0061AF10` decompile.

`0x00621780` paints a generic/source wizard in this order:

1. attachment compositor, back pass (`pass = 1`);
2. dynamic primary and secondary robe/body layers;
3. fixed selector primary layers (`+0x64c`, `+0x66c`);
4. fixed selector secondary layers (`+0x65c`, `+0x67c`);
5. attachment compositor, front pass (`pass = 0`);
6. native movement bob transform;
7. hat/head tables (`+0x6b0`, `+0x6bc`).

The exact Clothes builder map confirms the four fixed banks are
`1612..2019`, `2428..2835`, `2020..2427`, and `2836..3243`: each bank is
`17 poses x 24 headings`, not the ten poses owned by the separate Staff/Wand
attachment tables. The dynamic robe banks are selected separately; default
style zero maps to records `868..987` and `1228..1347`.

This generic renderer is not the authority for the equipped local-player
robe. The actual local route is
`0x0054BA80 -> 0x00538B80 -> equipped item vtable +0x20`, with the robe landing
in `0x00577DA0`. Its five arguments are, exactly, robe object, style-selected
frame index, fixed-bank frame index, actor scale, and an optional transform
pointer. The call site builds the style-selected frame as
`heading + trunc(actor + 0x220) * 24` and the fixed-bank frame as
`heading + trunc(actor + 0x238) * 24`. A clean right-facing runtime snapshot showed
heading `6`, actor `+0x220 = 0.0`, and actor `+0x238 = 0.0`, while the gait
phase at `+0x228` remained independent. That snapshot proves the standing
frame is `6`, selecting fixed records `1618`, `2434`, `2026`, and `2842`--not
the previously forced pose-12 records `1906`, `2722`, `2314`, and `3130`. It
does not prove that `+0x220` stays zero while walking.

The forced pose-12 interpretation was the anatomy bug: it put a down-facing
white cuff beside the correctly right-facing staff and body. Pose zero remains
the correct standing frame. The later instruction-level ABI audit below
corrects which Clothes banks ordinary walking advances; that correction is an
ownership result, not a hand-offset or CSS adjustment.

A read-only scan of the only live `Robe` item (`vtable 0x00785704`) in the same
clean process also recovered style `0`, primary color
`(0.657653, 0.837074, 0.821034, 1.0)`, and white secondary color. This validates
the equipped item and default dynamic-bank selection directly; element-specific
palette generation remains a separate loadout input.

The body palette is also a renderer input, not a cosmetic approximation.
`Skills_Wizard_GetPrimaryColor (0x00660760)` returns the descriptor-facing
element color after the native robe mix. The exact default vectors are Air
`(0.628921,0.763921,0.763921)`, Earth
`(0.566191,0.701191,0.566191)`, Ether
`(0.533809,0.398809,0.533809)`, Fire
`(0.600576,0.503076,0.465576)`, and Water
`(0.369926,0.429926,0.504926)`. The previous extractor started from guessed
saturated colors and applied the `0x0040FC60` mix itself, which produced the
wrong cyan value and could not preserve stock element identity. Static web
sheets must tint the primary banks with these descriptor colors once and keep
the default trim white.

The Clothes builder at `0x004E4CA0` gives the definitive field-to-record map.
Closer control-flow recovery corrects an earlier interpretation of records
`484..603` and `676..795`: `0x00538B80` draws those generic pose-dependent
attachment banks only when no item is equipped or the animation selection is
`-1`. A valid equipped staff takes the mutually exclusive staff branch instead.
The staff renderer at `0x00578D20` draws pose-dependent hand banks
`3244..3483` and `3484..3723` around its generated staff body. Adding the
generic banks to the normal staff branch would duplicate limbs and would not
match stock.

For heading `6` (right), the first normal-walk pose in the staff-hand banks:

- first pose bank, point 0: `(89.0, 38.5)` — foreground side;
- second pose bank, point 0: `(133.0, -23.5)` — background side.

The original web extractor split the two staff-hand banks independently and
flattened them around the shaft in the wrong order. The runtime web simulation
also advanced every robe and staff lane through five Clothes poses on travel
distance. Together those facts caused the visibly detached hand and flailing
staff while facing right. The equipped renderer instead advances only the four
fixed robe banks. The extractor must submit the heading-only staff composite
on one side of the body while independently selecting the fixed robe pose.

The apparent depth baseline is `0.5`, matching Clothes record `316`, point 0
`(0, 0.5)`. Confidence: medium-high inference pending an explicit confirmation
of the comparison operand in all compositor branches.

Direct `0x00538B80` decompilation confirms that record `316` point 0 Y is loaded
as the comparison baseline. Its no-item/fallback branch selects generic
attachment index `heading + animationPose * 24`, reads point 0 Y from both
`484..603` and `676..795`, and paints each on the matching side of that
baseline. Its normal equipped-staff branch does not enter that fallback.

Confidence for the generic-bank split, branch exclusivity, and `0.5` baseline
is high.

The call sites in `0x0054BA80` pass `1` before the body and `0` after it.
Instruction and decompiler evidence agree on the comparisons:

- pass `1` paints a fallback attachment when `point0.y <= 0.5`;
- pass `0` paints it when `point0.y > 0.5`;
- the equipped staff composite is assigned to the same two passes by the
  point-0 Y returned by `Staff_GetAttachmentPoint (0x005795E0)`.

`0x005795E0` returns an arbitrary serialized point from the selected Clothes
record. `Staff_RenderAttachment (0x00578D20)` can receive the full
`heading + animationPose * 24` record index, uses points 1 and 2 as shaft
endpoints, draws the generated shaft, skips its optional Clothes `11..12` glow
branch when the fifth argument is null, and finally draws both matching hand
records from banks `3244..3483` and `3484..3723`. A clean default-staff trace
had pose record `6`, selector `-1`, scale `1.0`, and a null optional-glow
argument. Thus both hands and the shaft are one pose-dependent item composite,
submitted wholly behind or wholly in front of the body; the two hand banks must
not be split independently.

A clean live read additionally corrected the source-of-truth wording for staff
geometry. `Staff_RenderAttachment` reads the active 240-record runtime table
through `DAT_00B2E984`; it does not dereference the serialized bundle directly.
For the default kit, all recovered runtime points match Clothes records
`3244..3483` exactly (right heading points are `(89,38.5)`, `(38.5,-61.5)`, and
`(-3.5,17.5)`). The web may therefore derive its static default sheet from
those bundle records, but the match is a validated content equivalence rather
than ownership by the bundle parser. The generated staff shaft and both hand
records remain one attachment pass.

The complete `0x00578D20` instruction stream also closes the remaining raster
registration gap. It computes `point1 - point2`, normalizes that vector through
`0x004035D0`, rotates it ninety degrees, and multiplies the perpendicular by
`sprite.logical_width * 0.5 * actorScale`. The resulting four corners are sent
directly to the normal textured-quad painter `0x00414710`; the source sprite is
not first stretched into an integer rectangle and then rotated. That distinction
is visible at right heading: the approximate web raster left the fixed white cuff
uncovered and made the arm look detached. Static extraction must inverse-map the
staff material into the recovered endpoint quad with bilinear sampling, then
composite both hand records in the same attachment pass.

Confidence: high from the three `0x0054BA80` call sites, `0x00538B80` branch
instructions, full `0x00578D20` decompilation and instruction stream, and the
clean runtime call trace.

## Normal hub walk frame selection

A read-only `8 ms` sampler against the clean direct stock process held physical
scan code `0x20` (D) for `1.4 s`. The local player moved and faced exactly
`90 degrees`/heading `6`, while these fields stayed fixed for the full sample:

- `actor +0x238` render phase: `0.0`;
- `actor +0x22c` discrete frame: `0`;
- `actor +0x234` advance rate: `0.0`;
- `actor +0x1bc` move-duration ticks: `0`.

The earlier conclusion drawn from that trace was incomplete. It correctly
separated `+0x238` from ordinary walking and correctly found a heading-only
staff call, but it treated the changing `+0x220` as transform-only state even
though `0x0054BFD4..0x0054BFE6` converts it directly into the style-selected
robe/body frame.

The complete stock update at `0x0054B592..0x0054B66E` resolves the three walk
accumulators. For movement magnitude `distance` in one fixed update:

- `actor +0x220 += distance / 10`, then wraps by subtracting `5` when greater
  than or equal to `5`;
- `actor +0x224 += distance / 25`, then wraps by subtracting `4` when greater
  than or equal to `4`;
- `actor +0x228 += distance * 5` without the local wrap in this block.

The constants are the executable doubles at `0x007DE810 = 10`,
`0x007DE960 = 25`, `0x007DE8D8 = 5`, and `0x007DE8C8 = 4`, plus the float at
`0x007DE970 = 5`. The local renderer `0x0054BA80` consumes these lanes as
follows:

- `trunc(+0x220)` selects the style-selected robe/body pose at
  `0x0054BFD4..0x0054BFE6`. Steady float32 travel cycles through `0..4`; the
  `>= 5` wrap makes `5` an excluded boundary;
- `+0x228` drives the half-frequency robe/front-attachment offset at
  `0x0054BB27..0x0054BB7C` and the final head/hat bob at
  `0x0054C35D..0x0054C50B`;
- `+0x224` is not read anywhere in this local renderer;
- `+0x238` remains zero during ordinary Hub walking with a nonnegative primary,
  so the four large fixed robe banks remain on pose zero in that branch;
- both calls to the equipped attachment compositor, at `0x0054BC2E` and
  `0x0054C071`, receive the quantized heading in `EBP`, not `+0x220`. The staff
  shaft and its two item-owned hand records therefore remain on pose zero and
  move only when their complete depth pass receives the recovered transform.

The two style-selected Clothes arrays at records `868..987` and `1228..1347`
are exactly five poses by 24 headings and contain the ordinary robe/body walk
cycle. The four fixed arrays at `1612`, `2428`, `2020`, and `2836` contain 17
poses by 24 headings. Ordinary Staff rendering indexes poses `0..9`; the
empty-hand wrapper maps into `9..12`; selected primary `-1` forces pose `13`;
and Wand rendering clamps into `14..16`. The clean ordinary Hub walk trace
selects fixed pose zero. The staff item, shaft, and its two hand sprites also
stay on pose zero there; they move with their owning painter transforms instead
of swapping walk frames.

Implementation consequence: retain the two native-owned authoritative phases
rather than inventing a client animation clock. The existing `gaitDegrees`
models `+0x228`; retain `walkCyclePrimary` for `+0x220`, advance it by requested
distance divided by `10`, and wrap it at `5`. This separate field is necessary
because `gaitDegrees` is bounded modulo `360`, while the two native phases have
different periods and cannot be reconstructed from that bounded value after a
wrap. Emit five columns for the style-selected robe/body sheet, all 17 columns
for the four common compiled-Robe fixed arrays, ten columns for Staff/Wand
attachment sheets and the legacy generic fixed-body view, and heading-only
head/special sheets. Never reuse the ten-pose Staff selector as the compiled
Robe fixed selector. Keep the continuous renderer-local transforms already
recovered.

Evidence: fresh no-analysis Ghidra instruction dumps of
`0x0054BFC7..0x0054BFF1` and decompilation of `Robe_RenderAttachment`
(`0x00577DA0`). The x86 right-to-left pushes prove that the computed
`heading + trunc(+0x220) * 24` value is argument 1, while the previously built
`heading + trunc(+0x238) * 24` value is argument 2. Inside the robe renderer,
argument 1 indexes the two style-selected arrays and argument 2 indexes all
four fixed arrays. The update instructions at `0x0054B624..0x0054B643`
compare literal `5` against the advanced `+0x220` value and subtract on both
equal and greater results. The exact five-pose size of records `868..987` and
`1228..1347` independently agrees with that excluded upper boundary.

Confidence: high. Argument ownership, bank lengths, and wrap comparison agree
at the call site, callee, updater, and serialized Clothes tables. The clean
right-walk capture is visually consistent with this ownership, but the binary
evidence is decisive without relying on subjective frame matching.

Unknowns: `+0x224` may feed another presentation or gameplay subsystem outside
`0x0054BA80`. The fixed-bank selector membership is no longer unknown: raw
instructions and the Hand/Wand action arrays account for every pose `0..16`.
