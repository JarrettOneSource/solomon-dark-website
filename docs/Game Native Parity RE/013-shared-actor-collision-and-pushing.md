# Shared actor collision and pushing

Relevant native functions:

- `PlayerActor_MoveStep`: `0x00525800`.
- movement/collision helpers: `0x00522c00`, `0x00522b20`, `0x00522a30`,
  `0x00522500`.

`0x00522c00` and `0x00522b20` are static/hazard overlap resolution paths.
The dynamic formula is the later `0x00526520` path, which is called by the same
`PlayerActor_MoveStep` lifecycle for the player and Students when controller
flag `+0x121` is set. Students set grid/collision membership flags (`+0x36`,
dynamically `+0x37`) and separately slow near other Students.

No native evidence supports a one-off “player pushes Student” branch. The web
translation therefore needs one shared actor-body solver: both player and
Students submit intended motion, world collision constrains the same bodies,
and iterative contact resolution produces mutual displacement. The player
overpowering Students must emerge from recovered drive/speed/body parameters,
not an explicit special case.

Complete decompilation of `0x00526520` and its two separation helpers recovers
the remaining rules:

- a root movement epoch copies actor `pushStrength (+0x2C)` into
  `currentStrength (+0x4C)` and stamps recursively moved recipients at `+0x48`;
- contact candidates come from the dynamic actor grid and are culled first by
  circle AABB overlap, collision-enabled byte `+0x36`, remove byte `+0x05`,
  and the native `+0x3C/+0x40` masks;
- when the mover is not push-enabled (`+0x44 == 0`) or the move is recursive,
  or when `currentStrength < other.pushResistance`, the mover receives the
  full circle separation from `0x00521E00`;
- otherwise `0x00521EF0` computes weighted separation with exact factor
  `(distanceSquared / radiusSumSquared)^4 * 0.99 + 0.01`;
- the recipient factor is clamped from
  `currentStrength / (2 * other.pushResistance)`, with controller bounds
  `0..1`; its `currentStrength` and recursive correction are multiplied by
  that factor;
- the mover then receives its own freshly recomputed weighted separation.

The strict comparison matters: equal strength and resistance take the push
path. NPC constructors place the five fixed Courtyard characters in the same
dynamic list with resistance `90`, strength `0`, and radii `15`, `30`, `8`,
`25`, and `25`; the player cannot move them. Clean live Student values confirm
dynamic resistance at `distanceToSplineTarget / 5.5`, strength `11..16`, and
radius `12..17`, while the player has resistance `10`, strength `12`, radius
`25`. Thus a Student can nudge an idle player, but sustained player intent can
overpower lower-resistance Students without a player-only branch.

Evidence: complete decompilation and instruction stream for `0x00526520`,
`0x00521E00`, `0x00521EF0`, and `0x00521090`; live actor-list dump in
`/tmp/native-hub-collision-exact-25336.json`.

Confidence: high for shared lifecycle, comparison branch, weighting,
recipient transfer, fixed NPC bodies, and emergent player/Student behavior.
